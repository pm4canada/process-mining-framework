# Why Process Mining?
What makes process mining so innovative is its ability to discover processes in an objective and data-driven manner. Traditional interview-based methods used to discover processes can be time consuming and error prone as it relies on the subjectivity of interviewees. Furthermore, as interviewees often only understand a small part of an overall process, it can be challenging to derive the full end-to-end process model. Using the right data, process mining can help to alleviate these obstacles and provide a more objective approach.

This is not to say that we donâ€™t believe in the interview-based method. Interviews can yield great qualitative results that complement the quantitative approach that Process Mining offers. Using both techniques together can provide a holistic end-to-end understanding of a process or service, giving the best chance at deriving solutions that take into account process performance and user needs.
