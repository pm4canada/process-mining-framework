# Process Mining vs. Business Intelligence
A common question we often receive is “What is the difference between Business Intelligence and Process Mining?” Business Intelligence is a reporting tool whereas Process Mining is an analysis tool. Business Intelligence helps you report on pre-determined KPIs whereas Process Mining helps you identify new potential KPIs that you would then report on using BI. Both tools are useful and complementary. In fact, some process mining tools have embedded BI capabilities and vice versa.

To illustrate this concept visually, imagine a foggy car window. As you wipe a few spots in your front window, you start to get a partial view of what is happening in front of you (Image 1 on the left); this is business intelligence. It is selective reporting of the overall process. However, with process mining (image 2 on right) the entire front window is defogged, and you get a full view of the end-to-end process. It provides a much more holistic view of your process or service. Process Mining provides a new level of visibility that BI tools traditionally did not provide.
