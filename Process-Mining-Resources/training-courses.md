# Courses
There are many free courses available for Process Mining. We include two free and popular options below. In addition to these courses, the majority of process mining software vendors also provide training modules that are specific to their software.

## Process Mining: Data science in Action (Coursera)
[This course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining) is a companion to Wil van der aalst's seminal book [**Process Mining: Data Science in Action**](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-49851-4). This course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.

## Introduction to Process Mining with ProM (Future Learn)
[This course](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/process-mining) provides a good overview of some of the theoretical underpinnings behind the various process mining algorithms, including the alpha, heuristics, inductive and fuzzy miner. It is not an introductory level course but is useful for those with a data science background that would like to go deeper into the theory behind process mining and how it works.
