For those that are keen to go more in-depth with Process Mining, we include three highly relevant books on Process Mining, Process Intelligence and Business Process Management.

## Process Mining: Data Science in Action
[-![Author: Wil van der Aalst](/Process-Mining-Resources/pmdsia-sm.png)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-49851-4)
This is the second edition of Wil van der Aalst’s seminal book on process mining, which now discusses the field also in the broader context of data science and big data approaches. It includes several additions and updates, e.g. on inductive mining techniques, the notion of alignments, a considerably expanded section on software tools and a completely new chapter of process mining in the large. It is self-contained, while at the same time covering the entire process-mining spectrum from process discovery to predictive analytics.

After a general introduction to data science and process mining in Part I, Part II provides the basics of business process modeling and data mining necessary to understand the remainder of the book. Next, Part III focuses on process discovery as the most important process mining task, while Part IV moves beyond discovering the control flow of processes, highlighting conformance checking, and organizational and time perspectives. Part V offers a guide to successfully applying process mining in practice, including an introduction to the widely used open-source tool ProM and several commercial products. Lastly, Part VI takes a step back, reflecting on the material presented and the key open challenges. 

Overall, this book provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in process mining. It is intended for business process analysts, business consultants, process managers, graduate students, and BPM researchers.

## Process Intelligence in Action: Taking Process Mining to the Next Level
[-![Authors: Lars Reinkemeyer](/Process-Mining-Resources/piaction-sm.png)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-61343-2)
This book provides operational guidance on how to bring process mining to the next level, with process intelligence enabling companies to improve process efficiency and realize value. Written by practitioners, it combines the editor’s 10-year experience in this field gained at Celonis and Siemens, with 12 best practice use cases from international companies representing multiple industries and domains. 

Part I sets the stage describing the evolution from process mining to process intelligence. The chapters guide the reader step by step, from getting started to driving adoption at scale. Success factors critical for digital transformations and a detailed path to value realization are presented. Best practices on operating models and Centers of Excellence (CoEs) are shared as accelerators for successful digital transformations. Part II presents 12 use cases written by transformation- and CoE leaders who have achieved significant impact and value with process intelligence in their respective organization. All use cases have been written independent from any particular software, with a focus on evangelizing the topic and showcasing how companies like ABB, BMW, Bosch, Merck, PepsiCo, Saint Gobin, Siemens, and others leverage the capability to drive value. Part III provides an outlook on the future of process intelligence from an academic and an operational perspective, with a special focus on the disruptive impact of GenAI with future scenarios, challenges and recommendations.

The book is written by practitioners for practitioners. Readers may have responsibilities as senior executives, transformation leaders, process managers and experts, consultants, change evangelists, etc. The book provides operational, hands-on tips on how to accelerate process transformation in organizations by detailing best practices as well as possible pitfalls.

## Fundamentals of Business Process Management
[-![Authors: Marlon Dumas, Marcello La Rosa, Jan Mendling, Hajo A. Reijers](/Process-Mining-Resources/bpm.png)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-56509-4)
This textbook covers the entire Business Process Management (BPM) lifecycle, from process identification to process monitoring, covering along the way process modelling, analysis, redesign and automation. Concepts, methods and tools from business management, computer science and industrial engineering are blended into one comprehensive and inter-disciplinary approach. The presentation is illustrated using the BPMN industry standard defined by the Object Management Group and widely endorsed by practitioners and vendors worldwide.

In addition to explaining the relevant conceptual background, the book provides dozens of examples, more than 230 exercises – many with solutions – and numerous suggestions for further reading. This second edition includes extended and completely revised chapters on process identification, process discovery, qualitative process analysis, process redesign, process automation and process monitoring. A new chapter on BPM as an enterprise capability has been added, which expands the scope of the book to encompass topics such as the strategic alignment and governance of BPM initiatives.

The textbook is the result of many years of combined teaching experience of the authors, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels as well as in the context of professional training. Students and professionals from both business management and computer science will benefit from the step-by-step style of the textbook and its focus on fundamental concepts and proven methods. Lecturers will appreciate the class-tested format and the additional teaching material available on the accompanying website.
