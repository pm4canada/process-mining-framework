[[{"l":"Welcome","p":["In 2019, the Government of Canada (GC) revised its IT policy framework, effectively marrying the concepts of service and digital under its new Policy on Service & Digital. This renewed policy states that fundamental to digital transformation is the need to emphasize the citizen experience and provide digital services that Canadians can trust and consume with relative ease.","Former Treasury Board President, Scott Brison, said in 2019: “we cannot continue to be a Blockbuster Government serving a Netflix Citizenry.” This statement rings truer today than at anytime in the past. In the latest edition of the UN E-Government Survey, Canada now ranks 47th for digital nations; in 2020 we ranked 28th.","The COVID pandemic exposed just how fragile some of the GC’s services are - from passports to immigration and pilot medicals. These services, when placed under stress, had trouble withstanding surging demands. Leaders lacked key operational insights to support timely decision making, quickly identify root causes, and respond with accuracy. The GC’s underlying digital infrastructure continues to be at risk, with some aging IT systems as old as 50 years.","Process Mining (PM) can help address digital service delivery challenges in several innovative ways. This document introduces process mining, its applicability in Government, and a framework for how to get started with PM in your Government department. This document and associated framework is meant to be evergreen and welcomes input from academia, process mining practitioners, local and international governments. Our aim is to empower others with the tools and knowledge to adopt process mining by sharing our lessons learned. As we continue to mine processes, we'll be sure to update this space with new findings.","It is our sincere hope that by illuminating our Process Mining work through the Public Service Data Challenge, that we can inspire and grow the community of process miners within the federal public service (and in Canada), while continuing to push against the status quo, and help Canada meet its digital ambitions. The Government of Canada's processes have traditionally been very opaque. It's time to illuminate them, optimize them, and live up to our commitments of open government through increased transparency and bold new approaches.","The status quo is no longer an option."]}],[{"i":"what-is-process-mining","l":"What is Process Mining?","p":["Author: Van der aalst, 2011 Process mining is a family of techniques used to analyze operational processes derived from event logs. Event logs can be found in many different types of information systems, from enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems (e.g., SAP) to case management platforms like Microsoft Dynamics. Event logs can also be found in IoT or embedded systems in industrial/manufacturing settings. The term event log is often synonymous with the more familiar term “audit logs”.","Event logs consist of digital footprints or activities taken throughout the lifecycle of a case. For example, when you apply for a passport, you submit an application with your photos, references, payment and other forms. As your application is processed, events are recorded in a system. One officer might verify your references while another may print the actual passport, and a third packages it for delivery to your home address. Each of these activities (i.e. events) are recorded in a system until the passport application is completed. We can extract these events in the form of an event log, that allows us to view the process, its performance and any bottlenecks with process mining tools.","The three most common types of process mining are:","Process discovery: In process discovery, we seek to uncover a process model based on event log data. Process discovery not only allows us to uncover the true sequence of events taking place in a process, but also highlights the varied paths taken to accomplish the same outcome. For example, in some less structured processes, staff may take slightly different steps in how they accomplish their work, despite arriving at the same result; these are known as process variants. Through process discovery we can visualize these process variants, identify bottlenecks, and identify the “happy path” - i.e., the path most instances of a process take or should take to be most efficient. This can help towards process standardization and lead to more consistent execution.","Conformance checking: In conformance checking, we build on process discovery to check whether a discovered process model fits the idealized (i.e. authoritative) process model. Often, we find that what happens in reality does not fit the idealized process model. When a process variant is not executing according to the desired model or service level standard, we have discovered a deviation. Conformance checking can also identify violations in a process such as the four eyes principle, for example, where two distinct approvers are necessary in a transaction to avoid fraud.","Conformance checking has two additional applications relevant to service delivery in Government. First, one can compare a discovered process model with the directives, standards and policies that must be adhered to remain compliant. Secondly, we can check to determine whether processes are adhering to their service level agreements (SLA). This is important for revenue collection as the GC modernizes its fee structures and establishes SLAs. Programs working on a cost-recovery basis must ensure their SLA is. When SLAs are not adhered to, the GC is usually required to reimburse (i.e. remit) this fee, and therefore loses the revenue.","Enhancement: In process enhancement we take our findings from both process discovery and conformance checking to implement improvements to a process. Such improvements are then monitored and adjusted in an iterative cycle until a process is optimized or considered “lean enough” that any further enhancements would yield diminishing returns.","Process Mining data can be examined from multiple perspectives. The control-flow perspective of process mining pertains to the sequence and ordering of events in the form of a process model. The organizational perspective examines the different roles which stakeholders or actors play in a process, and their degree of involvement in a process; the organizational perspective can be visualized in the form of a social network diagram."]}],[{"i":"why-process-mining","l":"Why Process Mining?","p":["What makes process mining so innovative is its ability to discover processes in an objective and data-driven manner. Traditional interview-based methods used to discover processes can be time consuming and error prone as it relies on the subjectivity of interviewees. Furthermore, as interviewees often only understand a small part of an overall process, it can be challenging to derive the full end-to-end process model. Using the right data, process mining can help to alleviate these obstacles and provide a more objective approach. This is not to say that we don’t believe in the interview-based method. Interviews can yield great qualitative results that complement the quantitative approach that Process Mining offers. Using both techniques together can provide a holistic end-to-end understanding of a process or service, giving the best chance at deriving solutions that take into account process performance and user needs."]}],[{"l":"Process Mining vs. Business Intelligence","p":["A common question we often receive is “What is the difference between Business Intelligence and Process Mining?” Business Intelligence is a reporting tool whereas Process Mining is an analysis tool. Business Intelligence helps you report on pre-determined KPIs whereas Process Mining helps you identify new potential KPIs that you would then report on using BI. Both tools are useful and complementary. In fact, some process mining tools have embedded BI capabilities and vice versa. To illustrate this concept visually, imagine a foggy car window. As you wipe a few spots in your front window, you start to get a partial view of what is happening in front of you (Image 1 on the left); this is business intelligence. It is selective reporting of the overall process. However, with process mining (image 2 on right) the entire front window is defogged, and you get a full view of the end-to-end process. It provides a much more holistic view of your process or service. Process Mining provides a new level of visibility that BI tools traditionally did not provide."]}],[{"l":"Public Service Data Challenge","p":["The Public Service Data Challenge is a competition and employee development opportunity open to all federal public servants in Canada. The Public Service Data Challenge invites public servants to propose new and innovative ideas that harness the value of the GC’s data assets. The GC is sitting on a gold mine of underutilized data assets that could be used for the benefit of Canadians.","In December of 2023, we submitted a proposal to explore the use of Process Mining to help streamline transactional services, by mining Passport and Immigration services, which were negatively covered in the media towards the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. This proposal was driven by early findings from Process Mining pilots conducted at Transport Canada, which showed promising results. In the first year of PM pilots at TC, over $180,000 of annual operating efficiencies were identified on a budget of $115,000. We immediately knew we were on to something and wanted to share the power of PM with the broader GC. Our proposal for the data challenge consists of 4 pillars:","Leveraging existing successes at Transport Canada: to help grow process mining across the Government of Canada.","Mining the Immigration and Passport services: to better understand opportunities to improve service delivery to Canadians.","Creating a process mining framework: to help other departments adopt Process Mining, based on our findings and experiences at TC and the processes we mined during this data challenge.","Replicating and scaling our insights and framework to create a GC-wide Process Mining CoE: to improve services, promote the use of process mining, build a pipeline of services/processes that could benefit from this technology, and upskill the GC."]}],[{"l":"Overview","p":["In Process Mining projects, data acquisition and preprocessing activities can easily comprise 60% of the project lifecycle. Negotiating access to data can be challenging as business/process owners often don’t understand process mining and are reluctant to share what it may reveal about their process(es). Accordingly, we’ve focused our framework on the initial process qualification, data wrangling, and efforts required to convince key stakeholders to try process mining. Our framework aims to ensure that the process mining projects you pursue are qualified and will deliver return on investment.","Of course, no process mining framework would be complete without a process model of the framework, we illustrate the high-level flow of our framework below:","To zoom and view these process models more closely, you can access them using the links below: Process Mining Framework Process Model"]},{"l":"Definining Research Questions","p":["As you start your process mining project, consider proposing several research questions that you'd like to investigate during the analysis phase.

Leemans, and Wil M.P. van der Aalst. You can read up on PM² in a paper found here."]}],[{"l":"Process Qualification","p":["In an ideal world, your organization’s Enterprise Architecture (EA) team would have an up-to-date repository of every single business process within your organization, documented and mapped in some kind of process notation such as business process model and notation (BPMN). This repository could be used to identify deficient processes that could benefit from process optimization. However, the reality is most organizations do not have this level of maturity and as such, we need to scan the organization to identify where opportunities are ripe for process mining.","From our experience in mining 5 different processes in the Government of Canada, we have created the following three intake questionnaires for departments to help identify potential process opportunities, qualify their suitability, and assess the technical suitability. Using this approach should help in building a backlog of potential process mining opportunities, while quickly discarding (or parking) those opportunities that do not qualify. Those opportunities that initially qualify will be ranked, and the processes you mine will be based on impact and ROI.","1. Process Intake Questionnaire 2. Process Evaluation Questionnaire 3. Technical Questionnaire","You should qualify every process sequentially, starting with the first questionnaire and ending with the last. If at any point during the qualification process you feel like the process is no longer a good candidate, you should considering parking or abandoning the process in favour of others with stronger potential. Process Mining is an effective tool when used in the right circumstances. However, it should not be treated like a hammer looking for a nail."]}],[{"l":"Data Preparation","p":["The Government of Canada is sitting on a gold mine of data. Some of this data is more suitable for process mining than others. The goal of this section is to help provide insights on how to find and identify good data, negotiate access, clean data, and prepare it for your process mining analysis. Combining the insights in this section with the process qualification questionnaires (above) should allow you to identify process mining projects that deliver a promising return on investment."]},{"l":"Where to Start","p":["Source: Process Intelligence in Action by Lars Reinkemeyer (2024) The most mined process in academic literature is the procure-to-pay (P2P) process. As cited in Reinkemeyer (2024), the core processes of accounts payable, procure-to-pay, order-to-cash and accounts receivable account for more than 50% of the total value realized by private companies. Starting with data within your ERP system can often be a quick way to show the value of process mining, as ERPs typically possess good audit logs of activities.","Within Government, good processes to start with would be high-volume processes running on ERP or case management systems.

This is why we recommend the use of Jupyter Notebooks in conjunction with the logprep4pm Python module previously mentioned.

You may also discover new findings (after the fact) that weren't part of your original research questions. Some initial questions you might pose include:","What is the mean and median processing time for a case? Is this too long?","Where are the bottlenecks and are they major?","Is there a clear happy path illustrated in the process model or does it look like spaghetti?","Is there a lot of re-work?","Where are the quick wins that we can implement quickly?","If we reassign work to a different resource, would the processing time improve?","This list is not meant to be exhaustive.
