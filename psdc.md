# Public Service Data Challenge
[![](/psdc.png)-](https://canada.governmentdatachallenge.com/shortlist-2/)
The Public Service Data Challenge is a competition and employee development opportunity open to all federal public servants in Canada. The Public Service Data Challenge invites public servants to propose new and innovative ideas that harness the value of the GCâ€™s data assets. The GC is sitting on a gold mine of underutilized data assets that could be used for the benefit of Canadians.

In December of 2023, we submitted a proposal to explore the use of Process Mining to help streamline transactional services, by mining Passport and Immigration services, which were negatively covered in the media towards the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. This proposal was driven by early findings from Process Mining pilots conducted at Transport Canada, which showed promising results. In the first year of PM pilots at TC, over $180,000 of annual operating efficiencies were identified on a budget of $115,000. We immediately knew we were on to something and wanted to share the power of PM with the broader GC.

[Our proposal for the data challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT3MuDf9ugA) consists of 4 pillars:
1. *Leveraging existing successes at Transport Canada:* to help grow process mining across the Government of Canada.
2. *Mining the Immigration and Passport services:* to better understand opportunities to improve service delivery to Canadians.
3. *Creating a process mining framework:* to help other departments adopt Process Mining, based on our findings and experiences at TC and the processes we mined during this data challenge.
4. *Replicating and scaling our insights and framework to create a GC-wide Process Mining CoE:* to improve services, promote the use of process mining, build a pipeline of services/processes that could benefit from this technology, and upskill the GC.
