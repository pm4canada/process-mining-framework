# Overview 
In Process Mining projects, data acquisition and preprocessing activities can easily comprise 60% of the project lifecycle. Negotiating access to data can be challenging as business/process owners often don’t understand process mining and are reluctant to share what it may reveal about their process(es). Accordingly, we’ve focused our framework on the initial process qualification, data wrangling, and efforts required to convince key stakeholders to try process mining. Our framework aims to ensure that the process mining projects you pursue are qualified and will deliver return on investment.

Of course, no process mining framework would be complete without a process model of the framework, we illustrate the high-level flow of our framework below:

## Definining Research Questions
As you start your process mining project, consider proposing several research questions that you'd like to investigate during the analysis phase. Make sure you have a clear goal in terms of what information you'd like to discover from your process mining initiative.

## Other Process Mining Frameworks
As a point of comparison, there are other frameworks available for Process Mining - the most popular being the PM² written by Maikel L. van Eck, Xixi Lu, Sander J.J. Leemans, and Wil M.P. van der Aalst. You can read up on PM² in a paper [found here](https://leemans.ch/publications/papers/caise2015eck.pdf).
