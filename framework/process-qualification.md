# Process Qualification 
In an ideal world, your organizationâ€™s Enterprise Architecture (EA) team would have an up-to-date repository of every single business process within your organization, documented and mapped in some kind of process notation such as business process model and notation (BPMN) . This repository could be used to identify deficient processes that could benefit from process optimization. However, the reality is most organizations do not have this level of maturity and as such, we need to scan the organization to  identify where opportunities are ripe for process mining. 

From our experience in mining 6 different processes in the Government of Canada, we propose the following three questionnaires for departments to help identify potential process opportunities, qualify their suitability, and assess the technical suitability. Using this approach should help in building a backlog of potential process mining opportunities, while quickly discarding (or parking) those opportunities that do not qualify. Those opportunities that initially qualify will be ranked, and the processes you mine will be based on impact and ROI.
