We believe that Process Mining can help Canada move towards a more open Government with less opaque processes. Process mining supports the public service values for stewardship of public funds, ensuring that processes are optimized and lean, which ultimately results in better service to Canadians. Whether you're a data scientist, business/process owner, executive, manager, there is a role for you to play in joining our movement.

With our declining productivity and GDP per-capita, Process Mining is ripe to enhance the productivity of businesses and organizations in our country. You can contribute in several ways:

- :icon-share-android: Consider a process mining pilot in your organization.
- :icon-mail: Email your elected officials and request that process mining be used for Government services.
- :icon-people: Join the [Canadian Process Mining Community](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/9271455/)!
- :icon-mark-github: [Submit issues here on Github:](https://github.com/pm4canada/process-mining-framework/issues) This framework is open source and we welcome input to make this as comprehensive and useful as possible. Submit issues or feedback to help us improve this framework.
